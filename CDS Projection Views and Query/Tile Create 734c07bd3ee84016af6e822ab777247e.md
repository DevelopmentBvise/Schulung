### Info

With S/4HANA2020, the WEB Dynpro Data Grid will be the default reporting tool.

The benefits are as follows:

- Available on Desktop and Tablet devices
- Adheres to SAP's Accessibility standards
- Includes a PDF format download
- Offers Exception Reporting Option to define customer-specific field name mappings using BAdI
- The Filters are shown in the header area of a Data Grid App and they offer a huge flexibility (no separate popup as we have it in Design Studio)
- The Navigation Panel can be hidden (more space on the screen

Some new may no longer be available by default on the SAP Fiori Launchpad, however will be accessible via the app finder.
